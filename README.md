# StrumKANet: A Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold NAS Framework for Strumming Pattern Recognition

[![License: CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC--BY%204.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

**StrumKANet** is an open research framework for the classification of categorical guitar strumming patterns from pop/rock audio recordings.  
This repository contains:

- A curated dataset interfac for Strummin' Dataset: annotated pop/rock songs with human-validated rhythmic labels.
- A full PyTorch training pipeline using Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold Networks (KANs) and Convolutional-Attentive encoders.
- Feature extraction (Pre-Processing) scripts and reproducible experiment configurations.


## Project Overview

This work is part of the *Strummin'* Gym platform, which supports technology-enhanced guitar learning.  
In particular, this repository focuses on *Phase 2* of the framework: extracting a **consistent strumming pattern** from real-world pop/rock recordings. Unlike classic tasks such as beat tracking or onset detection, this work targets the **mid-level rhythmic structures** specific to guitar accompaniment. The task is formulated as a **categorical classification** over a reduced set of pedagogically-relevant patterns (binary, quaternary, ternary).

## How to Use

1. Clone repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/StefanoGiacomelli/StrumKANet.git
    ```
    Move inside

2. Download and add dataset contents to the workspace:
    ```bash
    wget -O strummin_dataset.zip "https://zenodo.org/records/15862786/files/strummin_dataset.zip?download=1"
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    curl -L -o strummin_dataset.zip "https://zenodo.org/records/15862786/files/strummin_dataset.zip?download=1"
    ```
    unzip and move the ```"./dataset"``` folder (and all its contents) inside the workspace. 
    **NOTE**: inside the folder we provide ```data_processing.py``` and ```data.py``` for third-usage cases (you can safely delete them)

3. Clone ```rp_extract``` repository inside the main workspace:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tuwien-musicir/rp_extract.git
    ```

3. You are ready!
